# 🏹 Two Pointers Pattern in DSA

This folder contains my solved problems based on the **Two Pointers** technique — an efficient approach often used with sorted arrays and string problems to reduce time complexity.

---

## 📌 What is Two Pointers?

The Two Pointers pattern involves using two variables (or "pointers") to iterate over data structures — usually from:
- Start → End
- End → Start
- Or both ends moving toward the center

It helps eliminate nested loops and makes many problems solvable in **O(n)** time.

| 1   | `squares_of_sorted_array.py` | Return sorted squares of a sorted input array   | Start–End  |

> 🔄 More two-pointer problems will be added consistently as I progress through DSA practice.
