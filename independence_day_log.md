# 14th August 2025 â€“ Independence Day Log ðŸ‡µðŸ‡°

Took a pause from regular coding to celebrate Pakistanâ€™s Independence Day.  
Reflected on upcoming projects, organized plans, and explored ideas for future development work.  

No direct code today, but progress was made in setting the stage for whatâ€™s next.
