# 🔍 Binary Search Pattern in DSA

This folder contains my solved problems based on the **Binary Search** technique — a powerful and efficient method to solve problems on sorted arrays or search spaces in O(log n) time.

## 📌 What is Binary Search?

Binary Search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that:
- Works only on **sorted data**
- Cuts the search space in half with each step
- Helps solve a wide range of problems, from classic element search to more advanced range-based and modified searches

We often apply **modifications** to binary search depending on the problem constraints (first/last occurrence, condition-based search, etc.).
