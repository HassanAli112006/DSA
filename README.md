# 🔁 Sliding Window Pattern in DSA

This folder contains my solved problems based on the **Sliding Window** technique — a powerful method to optimize problems involving subarrays or sequences.

---

## 📌 What is Sliding Window?

The Sliding Window pattern is used to:
- Reduce nested loops into a single loop
- Improve time complexity from O(n²) to O(n)
- Solve problems that involve **subarrays**, **averages**, **counts**, or **conditions within a window**

## ✅ Problem List (So Far)

| No. | File Name                   | Description                                   | Type       |
|-----|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------|
| 1   | `max_average_subarray_k.py` | Find max average of subarrays of size K       | Fixed Size |
| 2   | `max_sum_subarray_k.py`     | Find max sum of subarrays of size K           | Fixed Size |

> 🔄 I will be adding more problems daily, including variable-sized window problems and edge cases.

## 🧠 Why This Folder?

This folder is part of my daily practice commitment to:
- Strengthen DSA concepts
- Maintain a consistent GitHub contribution graph
- Prepare for internships and remote job roles

---

## 📎 How to Run

- Each file is self-contained with input/output and comments.
- Use any Python interpreter or an online compiler to test.

---

## 🛠️ Upcoming in This Folder

- Variable Window problems
- Edge cases (evens, odds, constraints)
- Count-based & sum-based variations

Let’s master this pattern together 💪
